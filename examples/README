README file for DrawView example files
--------------------------------------

These are drawing files in various application formats, which should
all load and display in DrawView.

  'Ttnkhamun' is by Hans Rijnen and was originally included in the
  Vector package.  Try viewing with and without "Antialiasing" to
  see the difference.

  'Backdrop' is by Steven Haslam, downloaded from a BBS (probably
  Arcade, currently at http://arcade.demon.co.uk) a long time ago.

  'Spitfire' and 'Hurricane' were drawn by someone else, but I don't
  have a record of whom.

  'MultiPlay' and 'GraphicEq' are by Geoff Preston and were originally
  included in the Vector package.

  'Metro' and 'Barcelona' were drawn by myself after visits there.

  'Viking', as far as I can recall, is by Mike Matson and was
  originally included in the Vector package.

  'Coupons' was produced by ESM, as credited within the file, and was
  originally included in the Vector package.

  'AllCaps' and 'AllJoins' are test files for the Qt line drawing
  capabilities.  Some of the caps (in the 12 cases where the start and
  end caps are different) may look irregular compared with the others;
  this is because they are drawn "by hand" using different algorithms.
  The RiscOS Draw module is far more versatile...

  All the other files are by myself.

Any material here which ought not to be distributed will be removed on
request.
